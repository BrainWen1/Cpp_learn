A sunny morning greeted us as we walked into the park. The birds sang loudly, and a butterfly fluttered by.
But we noticed that some flowers were wilting. An old man sat on a bench, reading a book. Or was he napping?
And children laughed while chasing each other. The dog ran around, fetching a stick. A breeze carried the scent of grass, but it was gentle.
An apple fell from a tree, and a squirrel scurried to grab it. Or maybe it was a nut? The sun shone brighter, making the day warm.
But we had to leave soon, as clouds started to gather.
